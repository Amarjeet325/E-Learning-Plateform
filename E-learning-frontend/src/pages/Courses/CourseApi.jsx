### What is Web Development?
Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites. It includes:
- **Frontend Development**: Everything users see on their browser (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **Backend Development**: Server-side logic and database interactions.

### Key Points to Learn:
- **Frontend**: Learn how to create beautiful and interactive web pages.
- **Backend**: Learn how servers, APIs, and databases work together to make websites dynamic.
- **Tools**: Understand the basics of version control systems like Git and popular IDEs like VS Code.

            content: `
### Setting Up Your Development Environment:
To start developing websites, youâ€™ll need:
1. **Code Editor**: Install VS Code or Sublime Text for writing code.
2. **Web Browser**: Use Google Chrome with developer tools enabled.
3. **Version Control**: Install Git to track changes in your projects.
4. **Live Server**: Use a tool like Live Server for real-time preview.

### Hands-on Activity:
- Install VS Code and create a simple "Hello, World!" HTML file.
- Run the file in your browser and inspect the elements using Chrome DevTools.

### JavaScript Variables:
Variables store data. JavaScript uses **var**, **let**, and **const**:
- **var**: Function-scoped (avoid using in modern JS).
- **let**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned.
- **const**: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.

### Scopes in JavaScript:
1. **Global Scope**: Accessible everywhere.
2. **Function Scope**: Accessible only inside a function.
3. **Block Scope**: Variables declared with let/const within {}.

            videoUrl: "1JsJx1x35c0",
            content: `
### JavaScript Functions:
Functions perform tasks or calculate values. There are several types:
1. **Function Declaration**: \`function sayHello() {}\`
2. **Function Expression**: \`const sayHello = function() {}\`
3. **Arrow Functions**: \`const sayHello = () => {}\`

### Closures:
A closure is a function that remembers its lexical scope even when executed outside of it.
